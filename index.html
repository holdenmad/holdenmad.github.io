        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Holden Madagame (<a href="{{'https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/main-entry/madaagamin-vii' | url}}">ma-daa-ga-mii</a>) and I'm a primarily frontend web developer with some experience in apps. I have an interest in accessibility and collective liberation, which involves accessibility, diversity, inclusion, and other uncomfortable topics for some people.</p>
        <p>I have a background in classical singing and continue to perform in opera, musicals, and other types of performance art. If you're interested in this, check out my other website and social media.</p>
